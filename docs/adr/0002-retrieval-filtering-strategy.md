# ADR-0002: Retrieval Filtering Strategy

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Date:** 2026-07-06
* **Related:** ALE-76 (generation layer), ALE-77 (filter mechanism), ALE-78 (filter derivation), ALE-84 (expose applied filters), ALE-91 (similarity-score floor for `/chat` sources), ADR-0001 (LLM provider strategy), ADR-0018 / ALE-186 (revises Decision 4 — the floor no longer gates `/chat`)

## Context

After merging ALE-76, real `/chat` transcripts were reviewed against production data. For country-scoped questions ("frontend roles in Sweden", "backend roles in Denmark"), the retrieved top-k results were frequently from the wrong country — in one transcript, 4 of 5 retrieved jobs were outside the requested country entirely. The generator behaved correctly per ADR-0001 Decision 3 (it declined to fabricate a match rather than answer from irrelevant context), but a correct answer was never retrievable in the first place. This is a retrieval-quality problem, not a generation problem, and ADR-0001 Decision 5's retrieval/generation eval separation is what made that attribution possible.

**Root cause.** `load_jobs_into_qdrant` (`db/database.py`) builds the embedded `document_text` from job title, company, company description, and job description only. `Country`, `location`, and `Remote` are stored as Qdrant payload metadata (see README "Stored data") but are never part of the vectorized text. A query naming a country has no reliable signal to match against unless that country happens to be mentioned incidentally in the job description — confirmed directly against a live payload (a Copenhagen, Denmark job whose `document_text` contains neither word).

This ADR covers three related but distinct decisions: how to combine structured constraints with semantic search, whether to index for it, and where filter values come from when the caller doesn't supply them explicitly.

## Decision 1: Combine dense semantic search with structured payload filtering — not a sparse/BM25 "hybrid search"

**Decision:** Extend `query_jobs_in_qdrant` to accept an optional `country` (and later `remote`) parameter, translated into a Qdrant `Filter`/`FieldCondition` passed as `query_filter` alongside the existing dense `query` in the same `query_points` call.

**Rationale:**

- Qdrant applies `query_filter` and the vector search together, during HNSW traversal — not as two sequential passes. This is a query-time parameter addition to an existing call, not a new retrieval stage.
- `Country`/`Remote` are exact categorical fields already stored on every point. Filtering on them is deterministic and free of the embedding model's uncertainty about whether "Denmark" is semantically "close enough."
- **This is explicitly not "hybrid search" in the stricter sense** (combining a dense vector with a sparse/BM25 keyword vector for text-precision matching). That technique targets a different failure mode — poor ranking of specific keywords/terms within the embedded text (e.g. "FastAPI" vs. "Django") — and would require a collection schema change (a new named sparse vector) and a full reindex of the existing collection. Given the confirmed root cause here is a missing categorical signal, not degraded keyword ranking, payload filtering is the correct, much cheaper fix. Conflating the two would have meant paying reindexing cost for a problem that isn't the one observed.

## Decision 2: Add payload indexes proactively, ahead of demonstrated need

**Decision:** `create_collection` will create payload indexes at collection-creation time, not only when filtering performance becomes a measured problem: `PayloadSchemaType.KEYWORD` on `Country` (string) and `PayloadSchemaType.BOOL` on `Remote` (boolean).

**Rationale:**

- Without an index, Qdrant can still filter, but does so less efficiently at larger collection sizes (no index to prune candidates before the more expensive check).
- The cost of adding this now is one function call inside `create_collection`; the cost of adding it later is a migration against a populated collection. Given this project is explicitly expected to possibly scale beyond prototype, paying the near-zero cost now is preferable to a forced migration later. This mirrors the general project stance (see ADR-0001's dedicated cost/vendor-risk analysis) of taking cheap precautions against known future costs rather than only reacting after the fact.

## Decision 3: Filter values come from an explicit API parameter first; deterministic text extraction second; no LLM-based extraction for now

**Decision:** `ChatRequest` (and `/jobs/search`) gain an explicit, optional `country: CountryCode` field (ALE-77). Separately, when the caller does not supply it, a dependency-free function `extract_filters_from_question(question: str)` derives `country`/`remote` from the question text using a deterministic alias/keyword lookup table — not an LLM call (ALE-78).

**Rationale for splitting these into two tickets/decisions rather than one:**

They differ on every axis that matters for how carefully each should be designed:

| | Explicit param (ALE-77) | Text extraction (ALE-78) |
|---|---|---|
| Determinism | Full | Depends on chosen approach |
| Added cost/latency | None | Zero (lookup) or a full model call (LLM) |
| Failure mode | N/A | Silent misfire, harder to attribute than a bad explicit value |

**Rationale for deterministic lookup over LLM-based extraction, specifically:**

- `CountryCode` is a small, closed enum (`DK`, `SE`, `NO`, `FI`, `IS`, `EU` — see README "Multi-country support"). A lookup table of country names, adjectives, and major cities is a complete, exhaustively-testable solution for the actual observed failure mode (both real transcripts named the country literally).
- An LLM-based extraction step would add latency and cost to every `/chat` request for a problem a static table already solves, and — more importantly — introduces a second place where the system can silently get something wrong, in a system whose entire generation-layer design (ADR-0001 Decision 3) exists specifically to make wrongness structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely. Adding a probabilistic component to the retrieval-scoping step undermines that property for a gain (robustness to unusual phrasing like "Scandinavia") that hasn't yet been shown to matter in practice.
- This is the same reasoning ADR-0001 itself used when comparing Gemini against a self-hosted model or a paid tier: don't pay for capability the current evidence doesn't call for; record the trigger that would justify revisiting instead of guessing at it now.

**Precedence rule:** an explicitly supplied `ChatRequest.country`/`remote` always overrides anything derived from the question text. Inference must never silently override stated caller intent.

**Implementation (ALE-78):** Option A shipped as `db/query_filters.py` — a dependency-free alias/keyword lookup (`extract_filters_from_question`) wired into `/chat` via `resolve_chat_filters`. Option B (LLM-based extraction) remains a revisit trigger only. The module lives under `db/` (not a top-level package) because it sits on the retrieval path between the API and `query_jobs_in_qdrant`, even though it has no Qdrant dependency. Extraction rules: remote handling uses false phrases (`remote=False`), neutral idioms (`remote=None`, no filter), then positive phrases/keywords with a negation-window check; when multiple distinct countries appear in one question, no country filter is applied rather than picking the earliest match. **ALE-82 extension:** `EU_COUNTRY_PHRASES` (e.g. `"outside the nordics"`, `"non-nordic"`) also resolve to `CountryCode.EUROPE`, subject to the same ambiguity rule — a phrase plus any specific country/city alias yields no filter.

## Decision 4: `/chat` similarity-score floor suppresses weak retrieval hits — hard cutoff, not labeling (ALE-91)

**Decision:** After Qdrant returns top-k hits for `POST /chat`, omit any hit whose cosine similarity score is below `CHAT_SOURCE_MIN_SCORE` (default **0.70**, calibrated against `tests/fixtures/golden_queries.json`) from both `ChatResponse.sources` and the generation context. Use a **hard cutoff** (omit entirely) rather than a `loose_match` boolean or label in the payload. `/jobs/search` is unchanged — raw scores remain visible there for demo/search use (ADR-0004 Decision 4).

**Rationale:**

- Qdrant always returns top-k from a non-empty collection even when matches are semantically weak. A real `/chat` transcript ("Python developer jobs in Sweden?") showed unrelated jobs at scores 0.55–0.63 in `sources` while the generator correctly declined to fabricate (ADR-0001 Decision 3). The UX problem is misleading citations, not generation quality alone.
- ALE-91 left the mechanism open ("hard cutoff vs. label"). Hard omission was chosen because it composes cleanly with the anti-hallucination guarantee: no new "loose match" state for the frontend or generator to reason about. Complements ALE-84's `applied_country`/`applied_remote` (which answers "was a filter applied?") — this answers "how relevant is this specific hit?"
- **0.70 is calibrated, not guessed.** Against the retrieval golden set (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`), expected hits score ≥ ~0.71; observed noise sits in ~0.55–0.63. `test_golden_queries_expected_jobs_survive_chat_source_min_score` turns that into a regression guard.

**Post-retrieval filtering vs. query-time `score_threshold`:** The floor is applied in Python after `query_jobs_in_qdrant` returns `limit` hits — not via Qdrant's native `score_threshold` param. This is accepted at prototype scale: relevant hits ranked below `limit` are never fetched, and responses may return fewer than `limit` sources when weak hits are dropped. Pushing the threshold into the Qdrant query (consistent with Decision 1's "filter during traversal" pattern) is a documented revisit trigger, not a blocker for the current traffic.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Directly fixes the two confirmed failure transcripts using only data already stored on every point — no re-embedding, no new infrastructure.
- Payload indexing paid for up front removes a future migration cost.
- Keeps the retrieval-scoping step fully deterministic, preserving the anti-hallucination property ADR-0001 established for the generation layer — the same "don't add probabilistic surface without evidence it's needed" principle now applies one layer upstream, to retrieval scoping, not just generation.
- The retrieval/generation eval separation from ADR-0001 Decision 5 is what allowed this problem to be correctly attributed to retrieval in the first place — validating that split's design rather than adding overhead we don't use.

**Negative / accepted risks:**

- The alias/lookup table (ALE-78) is inherently incomplete — unusual phrasings ("Scandinavia", "the Nordics", misspellings) will not be caught and will silently fall back to unfiltered semantic search rather than erroring. This is an accepted, bounded gap: a missed filter degrades gracefully to today's (already-shipped) behavior, it doesn't produce a wrong answer.
- Remote negation detection uses a fixed phrase list and a small negation-window heuristic (not general NLP). Phrasings outside the closed sets may be missed entirely (falls back to no filter). Phrases listed in `REMOTE_NEUTRAL_PHRASES` degrade safely to no filter (`remote=None`); phrases not yet in that table may still be misread as `remote=False` by the negation window — the same kind of closed-set gap as alias completeness above, not a different failure mode.
- Filtering only on `Country`/`Remote` for now; other potentially useful filters (salary range, seniority) are not addressed and aren't motivated by current evidence.
- Keyword-precision issues within the embedded text (e.g. specific tech-stack terms) are *not* addressed by this ADR and may still exist — see Revisit triggers.
- **`/chat` may return fewer sources than `limit`.** The similarity floor (Decision 4) runs after top-k retrieval; weak hits are dropped from `sources` and generation context. A relevant job ranked below `limit` is never fetched — an inherent post-retrieval trade-off, not a bug.

## Revisit triggers

- If the ALE-78 alias table's real-world miss rate (queries with an obvious location/remote intent that aren't caught) turns out to be high enough to matter, revisit LLM-based extraction (Option B, rejected above) — with its own cost/latency/determinism tradeoff re-evaluated against real data at that time, not assumed.
- **Addressed (ALE-92 / ADR-0010):** ALE-92 confirmed keyword/tech-stack precision as a separate retrieval-quality issue (3/8 tagged queries, 37.5%) and ADR-0010 records the decision to proceed with sparse/BM25 hybrid search via FastEmbed. Full evidence in `docs/findings/0001-keyword-tech-stack-retrieval-gap-findings.md`. Implementation (dependency bump, sparse-vector backfill, fusion query, adversarial golden-set pairs) is intentionally out of scope for the ADR and left for a future implementation ticket.
- If additional structured filters beyond `Country`/`Remote` become clearly motivated by real usage (e.g. salary range, seniority), extend Decision 1's mechanism rather than building a parallel one.
- **Addressed (ALE-82):** `CountryCode.EUROPE` filtering in `query_jobs_in_qdrant` uses `MatchExcept` over the five Nordic hub country names plus `"N/A"` (unknown-location jobs), not `Country == "Europe"`. `/chat` inference enables `"europe"`/`"european"` aliases and `EU_COUNTRY_PHRASES` (e.g. `"outside the nordics"`, `"non-nordic"`) in `db/query_filters.py`; phrase + specific country mention still yields no filter per Decision 3. Jobs with `Country: "N/A"` remain searchable without a country filter.
- **Addressed (ALE-84):** `ChatResponse` now exposes `applied_country`/`applied_remote` reflecting whatever `resolve_chat_filters` actually resolved for the request. This does not close the alias-table completeness gap itself — unusual phrasings still fall back to unfiltered retrieval — but it lets callers distinguish "filtered retrieval returned these sources" from "no filter was resolved, sources are unscoped top-k." Frontend rendering decisions based on these fields remain for ADR-0004 to revisit.
- **Addressed (ALE-91):** `POST /chat` applies `CHAT_SOURCE_MIN_SCORE` (default 0.70) to drop weak similarity hits from `sources` and generation context. If evidence shows the post-retrieval floor is dropping too many relevant hits or wasting Qdrant bandwidth on points that are immediately discarded, revisit pushing `score_threshold` into `query_jobs_in_qdrant` for `/chat` only.

## Alternatives considered and rejected (for now)

- **Sparse/BM25 hybrid vector search** — rejected as the primary fix because it targets keyword-ranking precision, not the confirmed root cause (missing categorical signal), and carries a full-reindex cost the confirmed problem doesn't justify paying. Not rejected permanently — see Revisit triggers.
- **LLM-based filter extraction from question text** — rejected as the starting approach for ALE-78 on cost, latency, and determinism grounds; a closed-set lookup table fully covers the evidence in hand. Not rejected permanently — see Revisit triggers.
- **Re-embedding `document_text` to include country/location inline** — would let plain semantic search pick up location signal without a separate filter mechanism, but requires reindexing the entire collection for a problem structured filtering solves with zero reindexing and full determinism. Rejected as strictly worse than Decision 1 for this specific field, since `Country`/`Remote` are categorical, not prose the embedding model needs to reason about.

## Follow-up notes (post-acceptance)

### Decision 4 revision — cosine floor no longer gates `/chat` (ADR-0018 / ALE-186)

This is a scoped revision to Decision 4's hard-omit cosine floor on `POST /chat` sources, recorded in [ADR-0018](0018-chat-sourcing-follows-rrf-rank.md) rather than rewritten in place, to preserve the decision-history thread.

**What changed:** The floor **no longer gates `/chat`**. Eligibility is fused RRF top-k plus usable `document_text`. `CHAT_SOURCE_MIN_SCORE` still exists for evals/sweep; it is not gone. `/jobs/search` is unchanged (raw scores remain visible).

**Why not edit Decision 4 silently:** project convention is revision-via-follow-up ADR when a later ticket changes a prior decision's scope, so readers of this file still see what was originally decided and where the later change lives.
